# Wagtail Django Nuxt Website

This is a template made to make easy to start a website using Wagtail and Nuxt.
Connecting the backend and frontend using Django Rest Framework and Wagtail headless CMS.
This provides users to create a website using Wagtail and Nuxt. We say Nuxt, but you can use any 
frontend framework you want (Next, Astro, Angular, Whatever).

Using Wagtail you can create different blocks as we have on the example [here](frontend/components/blocks/Banner.vue).
If you see this a block that can be use anywhere.

`This template still in development, so more features will be added soon.`
